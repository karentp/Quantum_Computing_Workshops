# Hands-on with IBM Quantum Tools — Workshop Agenda
**Date prepared:** 2025-08-26

## Duration
**90–120 minutes** (can be shortened or extended).

## Learning Goals
- Understand qubits, superposition, entanglement and measurement.
- Build, run and visualize simple quantum circuits in Qiskit.
- Compare results on a simulator vs. a real IBM quantum device.
- Implement two mini-apps: a Quantum Random Number Generator and a tiny Grover search.

## Structure
1) **Welcome & Motivation** (10 min)
2) **Quantum Computing Primer** (15 min)
3) **IBM Quantum Tools Tour** (10 min)
4) **Hands‑on in Qiskit** (50–60 min)
   - Notebook 1: Qubits & Measurement
   - Notebook 2: Entanglement & Bell States
   - Notebook 3: Simulator vs. Hardware (Runtime)
   - Notebook 4: Tiny Grover’s Algorithm
   - Notebook 5: Quantum Random Number Generator
5) **Wrap‑up & Q&A** (10–15 min)

## Live Demo Checklist
- Share your screen with IBM Quantum Platform or local Jupyter.
- Keep browser tabs open to docs and the platform sign‑up page.
- Have the notebooks pre‑executed on a simulator (for speed).

## Backup Plan
If network/API to IBM devices is slow, stick to simulators and show screenshots of past hardware runs (saved in Notebook 3).

## Talking Points
- Quantum ≠ faster for everything; it’s specialized advantage.
- Noise: real hardware is imperfect; mitigations and error-aware design matter.
- LATAM and Costa Rica are active in quantum research and education.
